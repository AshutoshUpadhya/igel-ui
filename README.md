## ML made simple

Igel UI is the official app that allows you to easily interacte with [**igel**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) from a simple UI instead of using the terminal.

> **_NOTE:_**  The UI is still under heavy development


## Motivation

The goal of [igel](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) is to provide ergonomic machine learning for everyone. Both technical and non-technical users. 

I received many positive feedbacks from people and developers allover the world for creating igel. However, I noticed that some of them would find it great if a GUI can be implemented since non-technical users are not familiar with the terminal.

Therefore, I started this project. I'm actually a bad designer/frontend developer, but I don't want to let people down, who requested this. Therefore, I'm hoping that the community will support me on developing this app. 

We tried to use tkinter to develop a GUI first, since it's a python GUI framework but that wasn't a good choice. You can check this [**issue**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel/issues/17) for more. That's why, I made some research and decided now to use the **electron** framework. It appears to be a great choice for developing cross platform desktop apps and since it uses html, css and js, so why not right? :D

**Please** consider contributing and further develop this tool, no matter how small the contribution is. Your contribution will help a lot of people/developers allover the world and you will make people's life easier. Hopefully, one day you will say that you helped developing this amazing tool that many people are using ;)
