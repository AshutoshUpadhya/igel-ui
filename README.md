## ML made simple

Igel UI is the official app that allows you to easily interacte with [**igel**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) from a simple UI instead of using the terminal.

> **_NOTE:_**  The UI is still under heavy development


## Motivation

The goal of [igel](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) is to provide ergonomic machine learning for everyone. Both technical and non-technical users. 

I received many positive feedbacks from people and developers allover the world for creating igel. However, I noticed that some of them would find it great if a GUI can be implemented since non-technical users are not familiar with the terminal.

Therefore, I started this project. 


## Installation

The app is still under development. 

## Usage

I will provide some screenshots or videos/gifs in the future.
