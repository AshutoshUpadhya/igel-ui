## ML made simple

Igel UI is the official app that allows you to easily interacte with [**igel**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) from a simple UI instead of using the terminal.

> **_NOTE:_**  The UI is still under heavy development. Please consider supporting this projec!


## Motivation

The goal of [igel](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel) is to provide ergonomic machine learning for everyone. Both technical and non-technical users. 

I received many positive feedbacks from people and developers allover the world for creating igel. However, I noticed that some of them would find it great if a GUI can be implemented since non-technical users are not familiar with the terminal.

Therefore, I started this project. I'm actually a bad designer/frontend developer, but I don't want to let people down, who requested this. Furthermore, it's very exciting to build such an app. Therefore, I'm hoping that the community will support me on developing this app, especially since I'm very busy these days! 

We tried to use tkinter to develop a GUI first, since it's a python GUI framework but that wasn't a good choice. You can check this [**issue**](https://github.com/nidhaloff/igel/issues/17) for more. That's why, I made some research and decided now to use the **electron** framework. It appears to be a great choice for developing cross platform desktop apps and since it uses html, css and js, so why not right?

## Installation

The app is still under development. 

## Usage

I will provide some screenshots or videos/gifs in the future.

## Contribution

If you wish to work on this app, you can start by opening an issue or feature/enhancement and describe what and why it will be helpful. You can clone the repo and make a pull request afterwards. I will review it asap ;)
